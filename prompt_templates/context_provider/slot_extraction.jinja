### üß© Slot Extraction Rules

When you detect an intent that requires slots, extract the following information carefully:

- For `CreateTopic`:
  - `topic`: the name of the new topic
  - `summary`: a short description of the topic
  - `keywords`: important keywords related to the topic (comma-separated)

‚ö° If any required slot is missing, ask the user politely to provide it.

‚ö° Try to infer missing information from the previous conversation if possible.

‚ö†Ô∏è Never call an intent if required slots are missing.
