### 🕵️ Capture Pending Fact

If you detect valuable information from the user, but you cannot confidently insert, edit, or delete a fact (due to missing slots or context), you must use the `CapturePendingFact` intent.

- **Slot:** `fact_text` – the full text of the information.
- **Slot (optional):** `suggested_topic` – suggest a matching topic name if possible.

✅ Use this when you are uncertain about structured CRUD operations.
✅ The captured facts will be reviewed and consolidated later.
