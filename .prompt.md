# Project: Home Assistant – context_provider integration

This is a custom Home Assistant integration named `context_provider`.

Its purpose is to enhance conversations between users and large language models (LLMs) like Gemini or ChatGPT within Home Assistant. It does this by dynamically providing relevant context, including knowledge, memory, and event summaries, so the assistant can respond intelligently and naturally.

## Goals

- Provide topic-specific knowledge chunks to the LLM (`facts/`)
- Allow the assistant to “remember” and “forget” facts during conversation
- Retrieve summaries from the Home Assistant logbook
- Support prompt assembly before sending queries to the LLM
- Enable topic routing based on keywords or slot values

## Architecture

### Intent Handlers (`intent/`)
Each handler is a subclass of `homeassistant.helpers.intent.IntentHandler`.  
They process structured requests from the LLM.

Examples:
- `ProvideTopicFacts`: loads a file like `facts/energia.txt`
- `SummarizeRecentEvents`: queries the logbook with filters
- `RememberFact`: stores a user-provided statement with optional expiration

### Knowledge Chunks (`facts/`)
Static `.txt` files containing topic-specific facts.  
These are injected into the LLM prompt at runtime when a topic is recognized or requested.

### Memory Layer (`memory/`)
Stores short-term and long-term contextual facts, such as:
- “Papa is working from home today”
- “Mama prefers the shutters at 65%”

Facts can expire (short-term memory) or persist (long-term memory).

### Prompt Builder (`prompt_builder.py`)
Responsible for assembling:
- topic facts (from `facts/`)
- memory (from `memory/`)
- recent events (from logbook queries)

And building a structured prompt string for the LLM.

### Context Router (`routing/`)
Simple keyword or rules-based router that helps determine:
- which facts file to load
- whether memory should be referenced
- what kind of context should be injected

## Coding Style and Conventions

- Use readable, descriptive class names and slot names
- All intents should handle missing slots gracefully
- Use lowercase topic and slot values (e.g., `"energy"`, `"air_quality"`, `"boiler"`)
- All code must integrate with Home Assistant’s `IntentHandler` system
- Use async functions (`async def`, `await`) according to HA requirements
- Slot names should be in English: `topic`, `fact`, `ttl`, etc.
- Keep memory and knowledge separate, but allow both in a single prompt
